# Visual Studio Extensions

A set of extensions that add commands to [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) Tools and Solution Explorer menu when a solution or project is open. Each of these commands launch a particular app in the currently selected Solution Explorer item context. Some configuration options are provided.

The following apps are integrated:

- [Console](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) - a good Windows command prompt enhancement
- [ConEmu](http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/) - a superb Windows command prompt enhancement
- [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com/) - a great Windows Explorer replacement

More information on these extensions can be found on the [Visual Studio extensions page](http://goo.gl/wny4gn).
